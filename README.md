I am a recent graduate with a profound passion for technology and a dedication to solving complex problems. These qualities have led me to pursue a career in cybersecurity. I am excited by the field's dynamic and intellectually stimulating nature, where I can protect sensitive data and ensure digital integrity. The challenge of staying ahead of cybercriminals and solving new problems daily motivates me. In addition, I am committed to promoting inclusivity, believing that diverse perspectives enhance security solutions. I aim to combine my love for technology with a drive to make a positive impact in cybersecurity.

## Objective

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.

## Interests

I am currently studying for the SYO-701 Security + examination; therefore, my focus has been studying. Nevertheless, although constantly developing, I find vulnerability analysis incredibly fascinating because it allows me to delve into the intricacies of cybersecurity and understand the weaknesses that can compromise systems, networks, and applications. What draws me to this field is the challenge of identifying and mitigating potential threats before malicious actors can exploit them.

The vulnerability analysis process requires a meticulous and analytical approach, which I thoroughly enjoy. It involves scanning systems, interpreting reports, and assessing the impact of identified vulnerabilities. Additionally, I love staying current with the latest trends and techniques in cybersecurity, as this field is constantly evolving.

Moreover, vulnerability analysis is about discovering vulnerabilities and understanding how they can be exploited and their potential consequences. This aspect of predicting and preventing attacks excites me, as it feels like solving a complex and ever-changing puzzle.

I am mainly motivated by making the digital world safer and more secure. By effectively conducting vulnerability analysis, I feel that I can contribute to protecting sensitive data and maintaining the trust of users and organizations. This sense of purpose drives me to continue learning and improving my skills in this crucial area of cybersecurity.

## Current Learning 

Lately, I've been diving deep into learning Kali Linux, and it's been a fascinating journey. I started with the basics, familiarizing myself with the operating system's interface and the essential commands. From there, I delved into various tools Kali Linux offers for penetration testing and cybersecurity. Each tool has unique capabilities, and I've been experimenting with them to better understand their functions.

I've also been reading tutorials and watching online courses, which have been incredibly helpful in providing a structured learning path. Participating in forums and online communities has given me practical insights and tips from more experienced users, which has been invaluable. Iâ€™ve even started working on small projects and simulations to apply what Iâ€™m learning in real-world scenarios.

This hands-on practice reinforces my skills, and I can see myself getting more comfortable and proficient with Kali Linux daily. Itâ€™s a steep learning curve, but the progress Iâ€™m making is really motivating, and Iâ€™m excited to keep pushing my boundaries and expanding my knowledge.

## Certifications

I am scheduled to take my Security+ examination in the Fall 2024 and then move onaward to my Network+ certification before the end of 2024.
